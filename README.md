# CumminsPune-Team10-CurrencyExchangeRateAnalysis-

Welcome to the Currency Exchange Rate Analysis Dashboard project by **team 10!** 

## Project Overview

The project fulfills the following requirements:

### Definition

Exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another currency. A currency appreciates if it takes more of another currency to buy it and depreciates if it takes less of another currency to buy it.

### Problem Statement

Create a dashboard that allows users to analyze the exchange rates between two currencies over a period of time. Users have the option to select weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly charts. The dashboard displays the date on which the rate was at its peak (highest) and the date on which it was at its lowest.

### Tools Used

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [plotly-express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/)
- Code Editor: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Functional Tasks

-  Read and store the data from the file.
-  Create a user interface allowing users to select currency and desired duration.
-  Users can switch between weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual charts.
-  Fetch data for the given currency and time duration, showing the trend and displaying the highest and lowest rates with respective dates.

### Input

Exchange Rate dataset is provided in a CSV file format, containing exchange rates as currency units per U.S. Dollar. 

### UI Requirements

- UI provides the option to select 2 currencies (Currency 1 and Currency 2).
- Users can then select the year and time frame for analysis.
- Converted currency is displayed based on user-provided data.
- Users can visualize the data in two forms: raw and graph.
